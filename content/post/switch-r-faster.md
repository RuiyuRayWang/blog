Previously I wrote about how to build multiple R versions on Ubuntu and how to switch versions.

[R：同时部署多版本 & 版本切换](https://ruiyuraywang.github.io/post/mult-r/)

It turns out that my "old school" move (`ln -s`) is outdated. Now there are many handy tools to do the job for you.

[RSwitch](https://rud.is/rswitch/) is based on macOS. I'm using it personally, simply because I used it before and don't want to bother changing gear.

[rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig) supports multiple platforms and is probably the best choice for most users.

Happy R swithing!
