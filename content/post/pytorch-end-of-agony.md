The agonizing days of building everything from scratch (NVIDIA driver, CUDA, cuDNN) is over. 

Don't have to spend time on

[~~CUDA documentaion~~](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html),

or building

[~~Tensorflow：多版本部署、系统配置与版本切换~~](https://ruiyuraywang.github.io/post/build-tensorflow/).

Now, use PyTorch, and you will be amazed at ease of building a GPU capable meachine learning model with neural network.

[The PyTorch binaries include the CUDA and cuDNN libraries.](https://amytabb.com/til/2020/10/05/cudnn-pytorch/)
