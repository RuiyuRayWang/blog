Recently I ran into this wonderful [article](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2740) published in Nature Biotechnology written by Nick Loman and Mick Watson, about how to become a good computational biologist. The article is so brilliant that I figured I'd write about it in my (actual) first post.

### You’re a scientist, not a programmer
> The perfect is the enemy of the good. Remember you are a scientist and the quality of your research is what is important, not how pretty your source code looks. Perfectly written, extensively documented, elegant code that gets the answer wrong is not as useful as a basic script that gets it right. Having said that, once you’re sure your core algorithm works, spend time making it elegant and documenting how to use it. Use your biological knowledge as much as possible—that’s what makes you a computational biologist.

This is, for me, THE most important take home message.


Although officially doing my phD in a wet lab, I've managed to train myself to become a "bioinformatics/computational biology" practitioner (thanks to the patience and resources put in by Minmin). 
Working my way over the years, I find that I've been unconsciously forming a work-style that exactly matches the one described in Nick & Mick's article.
