Recently I ran into this wonderful [article](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.2740) published in Nature Biotechnology written by Nick Loman and Mick Watson, about how to become a computational biologist. The article is so brilliant and I thought I should dedicate my (actual) first post to write about it.

### Understand your goals and choose appropriate methods

> Key to good computational biology is the selection and use of appropriate software. Before you can usefully interpret the output of a piece of software, you must understand what the software is doing. ... Understanding the underlying methods and algorithms gives you the tools to interpret the results. That doesn’t mean you need to read through each line of source code, but you should have a grasp of the concepts.

There is always more tools to choose from than we can actually use. Choose tools wisely. Define your work with words accurately and search carefully. Use well-maintained tools. Use tools with higher user base. High popularity of a tool usually indicates good maintenance. If you decide to use a less popular tool, know the risk: you may experience more bugs or even criticisms during publication.

Understand what the tool is doing, but don't dive into the technical details too early. Having a good grasp of what the inputs and outputs are is usually enough for doing the job.

Critically, one must also have a good understanding of the biological question at hand. No tool fits all problems. Under different scenarios, one may have to look for different tools to solve the problem.

At a more advanced level, 

### Set traps for your own scripts and other people’s

### You’re a scientist, not a programmer
> The perfect is the enemy of the good. Remember you are a scientist and the quality of your research is what is important, not how pretty your source code looks. Perfectly written, extensively documented, elegant code that gets the answer wrong is not as useful as a basic script that gets it right. Having said that, once you’re sure your core algorithm works, spend time making it elegant and documenting how to use it. Use your biological knowledge as much as possible—that’s what makes you a computational biologist.

This is, for me, THE most important take home message.

The first rule of being a computational biologicst, is that you should make the center of your work biology.

Although officially doing my phD in a wet lab, I've managed to train myself to become a "bioinformatics/computational biology" practitioner (thanks to the patience and resources put in by Minmin). 
Working my way over the years, I find that I've been unconsciously forming a work-style that exactly matches the one described in Nick & Mick's article.
